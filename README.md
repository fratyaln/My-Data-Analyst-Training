## ðŸ”¥ Challenge 1: Python Fundamentals  
This week, I focused on Python fundamentals, including:  
- Working with **lists** and **dictionaries**  
- Manipulating data structures  
- Writing functions for problem-solving  

## ðŸ”¥ Challenge 2: NumPy Basics
This week, I explored NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical computing. I worked on:

- Creating and manipulating arrays (1D & 2D)
- Performing mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Statistical functions (mean, median, standard deviation, variance)
- Indexing & slicing to extract and modify elements efficiently
- Sorting and filtering arrays
- Optimizing performance using NumPyâ€™s built-in functions
- More exciting challenges coming soon! ðŸš€
